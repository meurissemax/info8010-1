# Deep learning

The goal of this project is to use different deep learning techniques in order to merge the style of one image and the content of another image (*neural style transfer*).

## Context

This project was realized as part of the *Deep learning* course given by Professor **Louppe** to the master students of Civil Engineering (Computer Science) at the [University of Li√®ge](https://www.uliege.be/) during the academic year 2019-2020.

## Language

The different models have been implemented in **python** (version 3) mainly via the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) library.
